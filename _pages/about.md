# About Me

Currently, I am a Research Intern at StepFun, mentored by [Dr. Quan Sun](https://github.com/Quan-Sun). Before that, I was a Research Intern at MSRA, mentored by [Dr. Dong Chen](http://dongchen.pro/).

My research interests focus on unified understanding and generation in MLLM. Please email me if you want to collaborate on academic research or have any questions.

I am looking forward to pursuing a Ph.D in 2027. Please feel free to reach out if you have opportunities!
